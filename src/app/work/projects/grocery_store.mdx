- **Performance Monitoring**: Query performance analysis and optimization recommendations

## Stored Procedures Examples

### Employee Management

```sql
-- Calculate total work hours for payroll
CREATE PROCEDURE CalculateEmployeeHours(
    IN employee_id INT,
    IN start_date DATE,
    IN end_date DATE
)

-- Generate employee performance reports
CREATE PROCEDURE GeneratePerformanceReport(
    IN department VARCHAR(50),
    IN period VARCHAR(20)
)
```

### Inventory Analytics

```sql
-- Product sales statistics
CREATE PROCEDURE GetProductStatistics(
    IN category_id INT,
    IN date_range VARCHAR(20)
)

-- Low stock alerts
CREATE PROCEDURE CheckLowStockItems(
    IN threshold_quantity INT
)
```
